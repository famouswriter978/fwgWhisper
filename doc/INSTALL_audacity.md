# FAQ for using Audacity - Free, open-source audio recording
[Back to fwgWhisper](../README.md)

## How do I install?
Synopsis: Windows go to the app store.   Linux run a command.   Apple download a [macOS Audacity.dmg](https://www.audacityteam.org/) file.

## What settings do I need?
The most important setting is mono.    You don't need high quality - the tool has been tuned for standard recorders.   160 kbps is more than enough.   96 would work.  Raw recording should be 44100 Hz 32-bit float.
